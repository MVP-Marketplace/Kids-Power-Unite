        <p>
          Children age 18 and under in a disadvantaged situation can apply for a
          wishlist item with the guidance of a supervising professional, such as
          a case manager. <br />
          They ensure that the wishlist gift is need-based and that parental
          approval was granted. Supervising proffessionals are asked to complete
          a grant application form on behalf of a child applicant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application includes a recipient avatar and nicname for privacy, a
          brief bio and selecting an item on Amazon for their wish. <br />
          Upon application review, KPU generates a profile and wishlist link for
          each gift request.
        </p>
        <p>
          The donor searches our wishlist page, learns more about the recipient
          and why the item is important to them. <br />
          The donor selects a wish to fulfill and purchases the gift with parent
          supervision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gifts are sent via Amazon to the supervising professional's verified
          address for distribution to ensure privacy.
          <br />
          We can't wait for your wish to be granted!
