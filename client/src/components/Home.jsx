                <h1>How does it work?</h1>
                <p>Children age 18 and under in a disadvantaged situation can apply for a wishlist item with the guidance of a supervising professional, such as a case manager. <br />
                They ensure that the wishlist gift is need-based and that parental approval was granted. Supervising proffessionals are asked to complete a grant application form on behalf of a child applicant.</p>
                <p>The application includes a recipient avatar and nicname for privacy, a brief bio and selecting an item on Amazon for their wish. <br />
                Upon application review, KPU generates a profile and wishlist link for each gift request.</p>
                <p>The donor searches our wishlist page, learns more about the recipient and why the item is important to them. <br/>
                The donor selects a wish to fulfill and purchases the gift with parent supervision.</p>
                <p>Gifts are sent via Amazon to the supervising professional's verified address for distribution to ensure privacy.<br/>
                We can't wait for your wish to be granted!</p>
